# LC3TUI

LC3 simulator with a simple terminal UI, written in C

![alt text](screenshots/1.png)
*TUI with loaded assembly (with debug info), PC and a breakpoint visible, some output and queued input. Registers have already been modified*


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Linux (untested on Windows/MacOS)
* C compiler
* ncurses


### Installing

* clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/beeldscherm/lc3tui.git
```

* Either run the makefile or compile the C files using your preferred compiler
```
make
```


### Running

After compilation, running the executable will put you into the TUI.
The executable generated by the makefile is called `lc3tui`.


### Help

```
Controls:
    Escape  | Quit the TUI.
    Up      | Move the memory view up one address.
    Down    | Move the memory view down one address.
    :       | Start typing a command
```


To see a list of possible TUI commands, run `:help`.
If you do not feel like doing that, here is the list of commands

```
Commands:
    l[oa]d FILE            | Loads .lc3 file into memory
    b[reak]p[point] N ...  | Sets breakpoint at provided locations (PC assumed).

    r[eg] R N              | Sets register R to value N.
    run                    | Run simulator until breakpoint or halted.
    h[alt]                 | Halt simulator.
    st[ep] [N]             | Execute N instructions (1 assumed), or until breakpoint.
